The purpose of this project is just to show how I create code and its structure in Unity. In this project I implemented SOLID principles, several design patterns such as Strategy Pattern, Factory Pattern, Mediator Pattern and Observer Pattern. I also use FSM to control Player State and Object Pooling to control background and obstacle spawn.
